#modules
A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. 
The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. 
Within a module, the moduleâ€™s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__.
Importing modules will decide the result we want to get. That is why the importing modules are important.
